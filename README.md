# Randomly assign projects to students
Script to randomly assign projects to students.
Students are not assigned the project created by their own group.
Students are not assigned a project that is based on the case study their own group's project is based on.

To use, create two local files: `students.csv` for students and groups, and `projects.csv` for projects, groups and case studies. See example files for expected structure of each file.
